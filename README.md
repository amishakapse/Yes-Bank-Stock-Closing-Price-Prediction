# Yes-Bank-Stock-Closing-Price-Prediction
## Supervised Machine Learning.

Developed a regression model for Yes Bank Closing Price prediction using machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, and random forest. Conducted exploratory data analysis on large datasets to identify significant predictor variables and performed feature selection techniques such as Principal Component Analysis and Recursive Feature Elimination. Utilized hyperparameter tuning techniques to improve the performance of the machine learning model, resulting in increased accuracy and efficiency of bike-sharing operations.
## Problem statement

Yes Bank is a well-known bank in the Indian financial domain. Since 2018, it has been in the news because of the fraud case involving Rana Kapoor. Owing to this fact, it was interesting to see how that impacted the stock prices of the company and whether Time series models or any other predictive models can do justice to such situations. This dataset has monthly stock prices of the bank since its inception and includes closing, starting, highest, and lowest stock prices of every month. The main objective is to predict the stockâ€™s closing price of the month.

## The process of our analysis will be the following step:

1. Understanding the Datasets.
2. Data preparation and analyze the data.
3. Splitting the Data.
4. linear regression.
5. lasso regression.
6. ridge regression.
7. elasticnet regression.
8. conclusion.
